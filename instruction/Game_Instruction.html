<p>In the following, you will be exchanging units with five other participants in a market to earn money. In the beginning of each round, you will be given 20 units. You will exchange units by sending exchange offers to other participants or by accepting the offer of another participant. The amount you send and the amount you receive must always add up to 20 units. For each unit you receive through exchange, you will receive two points. For each unit left from your initial budget, you will receive one point. You will be playing 30 rounds.</p>

<p>After you have agreed with another participant to exchange, you will be asked how many units you want to send. You will be allowed to deviate from your agreement by up to three points. That is, you may send up to three units more or less than agreed upon. The participant you exchange with might also deviate from the agreement by up to three points. After both of you sent the units, you will be informed about the decision of your partner.</p>

<p>While making your exchange decisions, you will be informed about the deviations of other participants in all previous exchanges (with you/ with any participant in the session). Analogously, your past deviations will be displayed to (your respective exchange partner / all participants in the session).</p>

<p>After 30 rounds of exchange, you will be asked to send gifts to other participants in the session. Next, you will answer a set of questions about your relationships to the participants in the session. In the end, you will learn about your overall payment, consisting of the points you earned in the exchange rounds and the gifts you received from other players.</p>
