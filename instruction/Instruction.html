<p>This study is being done to understand how people make decisions. The experiment will take approximately 35 minutes. You must be 18 or older to participate. The potential risks from taking part in this are similar to decisions in daily life.</p>
<p>The experiment consists of two parts. In the first part, you will divide an amount of money between you and another participant in this session. In the second part, you will pick items that can be of different quality. In this part, your earnings depend on the quality of the items you and the other participants pick.</p>
<p>In this study, the researchers will not ask for any identifying information. The data for this study will be kept confidential to the extent allowed by EU law. No published results will identify you, and your name will not be associated with the findings. The results of this study may be published or presented at professional meetings, but the identities of all research participants will remain anonymous. The collected data is stored and published according to open science standards.</p>
<p>Do not communicate with other participants, and do not involve people outside the experiment in your decisions. Do not share the participation link with anyone.</p>
