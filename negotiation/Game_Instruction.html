<p>In the following, you will be trading units with five other participants to earn money. You will play a number of rounds between 20 and 30 that will be determined by a random process. In each round, you will be given {{C.UNIT_BUDGET}} units. Each round consists of three steps. First, you will send trading offers to other participants and receive trading offers from other participants. The amount you send and the amount you receive always add up to {{C.UNIT_BUDGET}} units. For each unit you receive through trade, you will receive {{ C.PAY_TRADED_UNIT }}. For each unit left from your budget, you will receive {{ C.PAY_BUDGET_UNIT }}. </p>

<p>Second, you may accept or decline offers sent by other participants. If you decline an offer, the sender can send you another offer. If you accept an offer, you agreed to a trade and all of your pending offers will be closed since you can only do one trade with one other participant per round. That is, if you accept an offer you are excluded from further negotiation for the ongoing round. You will have three minutes (five minutes in the first round) to negotiate a trade with another participant. If you have not agreed to a trade after three minutes, you will not trade in the ongoing round.</p>

<p>Third, after agreeing to a trade, you will be asked how many units you want to send. You will be allowed to send up to
    {{C.DEVIATION}} units more or less than agreed on. The participant you trade with might also send up to {{C.DEVIATION}} units more or less than the agreed amount. After both of you sent the units, you will be informed about the decision of the participant you traded with.</p>

<p>While negotiating your trades, you will be informed about the differences between agreed and sent amount of other participants in all previous trades (with you / with all five participants). Analogously, in all following rounds, your differences between agreed and sent amounts will be displayed to (the respective person you traded with / all five participants).</p>

<p>Below, you see the interface you will use for the negotiation. You can see, that the participant has received an offer from participant ORANGE and has sent an offer to participant RED. He or she might accept or decline the offer from participant ORANGE. You can also see that the participant has information about the past behavior of participant BLUE and GREEN...</p>

<p>After the last round of trading, you will be asked to send gifts to other participants in the session. Next, you will answer a set of questions about your relationships to the participants in the session. In the end, you will learn about your overall earnings.</p>
